Hello, you’re chatting with Rene. How may I help you? I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s see what we can do to fix this issue. Could you please try 
the following steps for me? First, could you push the wifi connection button, hold for 3 seconds, then let me know if the power light is slowly 
blinking on and off every second? Great. Thank you! Now, please check in your Contoso Coffee app. Does it prompt to ask you to connect with the 
machine? I’m very sorry to hear that. Let me see if there’s another way to fix the issue. Please hold on for a minute.
