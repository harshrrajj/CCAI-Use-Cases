Certainly. Flying from Sydney? Thursday the 16th, right. There are three flights that day. Do you prefer flying with any particular airline? 
Yes, there is. Air Canada is the most expensive airline at 4,000 to six thousand dollars for business class. Depending on the date of return, 
Qantas is 3000 to 6000 and Pacific, the Budget Airline charges between 2000 and 3500. Sure. Let me just enter the return date into the computer. 
Okay, Air Canada has tickets for $4,600. Qantas has them for $4,200. Pacific has tickets for $3,200. Those prices all include taxes and surcharges. 
Of course. Let's look at Air Canada first. Leaves Sydney at 10 a.m. and arrives in Toronto at 10 a.m. local time. There's a stopover in Vancouver. 
The Qantas flight leaves Sydney at 1:45 and arrives at 10:15 a.m. Thereâ€™s also a stopover in Vancouver but it's shorter than the Air Canada one. 
Pacific flies via Los Angeles and leaves at 6:15 arriving at 11:55 p.m. Well, budget Airlines do offer cheaper tickets, but they are often not so 
advantageous in other ways. Let me check. The Air Canada flight leaves Toronto at 4 o'clock and arrives at six o'clock local time. The Qantas 
flight leaves at 9:00 a.m. and arrives at 11 a.m. local time in Sydney. Pacific, the Pacific flight leaves Toronto at 10:25 and arrives at 6:10 
local time in Sydney. Again, not very convenient timing. Yes, they are. Right! I'll book that for you. Shall I? Do you have your passport with you? 
Thank you. I'll just enter your details. Okay. Could you just check this printout? Make sure that I've spelt your name correctly and have written your 
passport number correctly too. Will you paying by credit card? Oh, I'm sorry. I'll correct that. Double E-C-E. Okay, Mary hyphen an, joined together 
with hyphen. Is the passport number, okay? Certainly. Shall I use the company name as it appears on the credit card. ABC stocks? Okay. Thank you. 
Could you sign here, and here? Thank you. I'll just print out your tickets.
