Good morning. I'd like to book a flight to Toronto, please. Yes. On Thursday, please. I've heard that Air Canada is good, but expensive. Is there a big difference in prices between the airlines? I'll be flying business class. 
Wow, that's quite a difference in prices. I'm returning on from Wednesday 22nd. So could you check the return prices for me? Okay, before I make a decision, I would like to know the departure and arrival times, in both directions. 
Oh! That doesn't sound very convenient. Flying by Pacific, I mean. How about the returned flights? No, it isn't. No, it isn't. Are the stopovers the same as on the outward journey? 
Well, I have a business appointment on Wednesday the 22nd, in the morning. So, unfortunately I can't take the Qantas flight. The Pacific flight times are too inconvenient. 
So I'll take the Air Canada flight even though it's more expensive. Yes, I do. Here, you are. Yes. I have a company credit card. Here, you are. Oh, my name is Reece with a C not with an S. 
And my given names are hyphenated. Mary hyphen an with an e. Oh, you've got that. Sorry. Yes, could you give me an official invoice, please? I need it for my company. 
Yes. Thank you.
